Explore BikeShare Data Using Python
by Madu Miracle


Introduction
This project uses python to create a user-friendly script that helps explore a data set related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The code loads the data and delivers a descriptive statistics based on user-defined criteria in an interactive way.

Each files contains six columns representing different attributes for each record in the system:

Start Time
End Time

User Type
Gender
Year of Birth
The last two columns are not available for Washington.

Requirements
It was required to explore the data to answer some descriptive statistics
for the following parameters in a specified city and/or time interval based on user defined values.
The code should provide the user with an interactive response experience.
The required parameters are:

Most common month for travel
Most common day of the week for travel
Most common hour of the day for travel
Most common start station
Most common end station
Most common combination of start/end stations
Total travel time
Average travel time
Counts of each user type
Counts of each gender
Earliest, most recent, most common year of birth

Credits
